# My Phrase Book
My Phrase Book is a mobile application which main aim is to help those who are struggling with memorizing phrases in foreign languages. This educational tool is a virtual representation of a vocabulary book.
The application can help these people by offering them the possibility to create and share Phrase Books, where they can store words in two languages. They can later iterate over these words, matching them with their meaning and learning them.
The users can also take tests to see how they are proceeding in the learning of a Phrase Book.

## Functionality
My Phrase Book gives the ability to the user to selects which languages he wants to learn. With this, we can make the language learning process more interesting than it can be with the apps which have a concrete word pool - the user usually knows half of those words and skips them during learning, as they are only a waste of time to see.
The ability to add and remove own words are supporting this value, just as the intelligent word selection for tests.
